Bruin Dine provides users with UCLA Dining menu information for menu items that the user likes. This full-stack application helps students in many ways - UCLA’s dining menu can often be complicated, and this way, students who have dietary restrictions or other preferences can more easily navigate menu options.

* Various **options** for utilizing the app
  * Users will be able to use the mobile application built with React/React-Native as well as use the Chrome extension to view some of the data on the  browser
* Dyamic **web-scraped** UCLA Dining Hall data (Additional distinct feature #1)
