Chrome Extension:

"manifest.json":
- The file includes all initialization & setups for a Chrome extension
- "content_scripts" - "matches" to change permissions
- "content_scripts" - "js" to add new JavaScript files needed
- No comments are allowed in .json files

Javascript files:
- A contents script runs immediately after a webpage loads; a background script 
runs after a button is pressed, etc.
- Clicking on the icon ("pinned") would trigger a browser action, which is
listened by the background script.
- "sendMessage", "onMessage": communicate between scripts & web contents
