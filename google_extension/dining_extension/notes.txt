To test the app/extension:
- First run "npm install" in the dining_extension directory.
- After node modules are loaded, run "npm run build" in the dining_extension
directory, which creates/updates the "build" folder.
- In Chrome extension manager, "load unpacked" the "build" folder.
- After some changes to the app, we can test the website simply by running "npm start".
If we want to test the extension icon to see if the new features are compatible in the pop-up,
run "npm run build" first to update the "build" folder and reload the extension.



Current problems:
- Starting at line #8 of renderFuncs/renderTimeData.js, I left the firebase codes 
commented out to test the website without over-reading the database. 
- More dining places to be added, but just the same boxes.
- Need to figure out how to click on the boxes & go to another extension page
as shown in Marina's Figma page. Or probably we just show them when 
"flipped" if we can't figure out.
