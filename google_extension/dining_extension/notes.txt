To test the app/extension:
- First run "npm install" in the dining_extension directory.
- After node modules are loaded, run "npm run build" in the dining_extension
directory, which creates/updates the "build" folder.
- In Chrome extension manager, "load unpacked" the "build" folder.
- After some changes to the app, we can test the website simply by running "npm start".
If we want to test the extension icon to see if the new features are compatible in the pop-up,
run "npm run build" first to update the "build" folder and reload the extension.



Current problems:
- Is there a way we can use the data in Firebase as well? I only have the extension
display the capacity directly on the webpage. If we don't have access to more data 
then I think we're good.
- Starting at line #8 of renderFuncs/renderTimeData.js, I left the firebase codes 
commented out to test the website without over-reading the database. 
- I put some flipcards in the app for demo/better visuals. Feel free to change it 
or add any other styles.
